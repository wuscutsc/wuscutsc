            <h2>Since 1987</h2>
            <p>Since its inception in 1987, WUSC UTSC has made remarkable contributions to the lives of refugees through
                the Student Refugee Program. Each year, the committee has successfully sponsored one student, meaning
                that as of this year, WUSC UTSC has sponsored a total of 37 students.</p>
            <p>Each of these students has traveled a profound journey, from uncertain futures in refugee camps to
                realizing their dreams of higher education and a promising future in Canada. The sponsorship of these
                students goes beyond mere financial assistance; it involves a comprehensive support system tailored to
                address educational, social, and integration needs within the UTSC campus and the wider community.</p>

            <h2>Students Testimonials</h2>
            <div class="testimonial">
                <h3>Bishar Adam Salat</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">Former SRP Former student, Masters in degree in Industrial relations and Human
                    Resources – University of Toronto</p>
                <p>Joining the Student Refugee Program was the gateway to transforming my life and career. After fleeing
                    conflict in my homeland, I was given the opportunity to pursue higher education at the University of
                    Toronto, where I completed my Master's in Industrial Relations and Human Resources. This program
                    didn't just educate me; it sculpted my ability to empathize, strategize, and lead within the complex
                    landscapes of global corporations.
                    Today, as an HR professional at Amazon, I implement innovative workforce solutions that not only
                    enhance productivity but also ensure an inclusive work environment. My role allows me to give back,
                    creating policies that support diversity and inclusion—a testament to the values instilled in me
                    through the SRP.</p>

                <h3>Chol Abit Bior</h3>
                <p class="subtitle">Student, University of Toronto Scarborough</p>
                <p>Growing up, my fascination with how life works at a molecular level was just a distant dream, as
                    access to education in my home country was disrupted by ongoing conflicts and instability.
                    The opportunity to study Biochemistry at UTSC has been nothing short of transformative. The rigorous
                    academic environment, coupled with the support from the WUSC Local Committee, has not only helped my
                    scientific enthusiasm but also empowered me as an advocate for global health issues. I'm currently
                    involved in research aimed at developing cheaper, more effective drug therapies for diseases that
                    plague my home region.</p>
